# webgme-barebone
[WebGME](https://webgme.org) is a customizable, generic, web-based modeling framework. By default it provides a webserver and a adaptive user-interface. It can be used as such, but the real power comes in the way it can be customized with code generator, custom visualization, custom REST routers etc.

In customization app (which this repo is an barbone example of), WebGME is used a node-module (published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webgme)). These repositories must conform to a special structure. By installing [webgme-cli](https://github.com/webgme/webgme-cli) globally (also publish on npm) this structure can be generated and using the same tool boilerplates for extensions can be generated.
