# webgme-barebone
[WebGME](https://webgme.org) is a customizable, generic, web-based modeling framework. By default it provides a webserver and an adaptive user-interface. It can be used as such, but the real power comes in the way it can be customized with code generators, custom visualization, REST routers etc.

In a customization app (which this repo is an barbone example of), WebGME is used a node-module (published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webgme)). These repositories must conform to a special structure. By installing [webgme-cli](https://github.com/webgme/webgme-cli) as a global node-module (also publish on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webgme-cli)) this structure can be generated with a simple command. Using the same tool, boilerplates for extensions can be generated, shared and imported between projects.
